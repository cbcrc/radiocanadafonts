FONTLOG for Radio-Canada
-------------------

This file provides detailed information on the Radio-Canada font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Demo fonts
and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
--------------------------

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, or CBC/Radio-Canada, is a Canadian
crown corporation that serves as the national public radio and television
broadcaster. In early 2017, work started on a custom typeface for use by
CBC/Radio-Canada. In 2021 this typeface was expanded to cover a wider range
of weights and now includes roman and italic variable fonts. Work on support
for the Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Unicode block is a possibility
as this typeface continues to expand.


Security and Integrity
