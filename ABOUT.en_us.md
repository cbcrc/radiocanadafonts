# About Radio-Canada Fonts

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, or CBC/Radio-Canada, is a Canadian crown corporation that serves as the national public radio and television broadcaster.

In early 2018, work started on a custom typeface for use by CBC/Radio-Canada. In 2022 this typeface was expanded to cover a wider range of weights and now includes roman and italic variable fonts. Work on support for the [Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics) Unicode block is a possibility as this typeface continues to expand.

This project has been selected as a winner at the 2018 Communication Arts Typography competition in the Typeface Design category.
